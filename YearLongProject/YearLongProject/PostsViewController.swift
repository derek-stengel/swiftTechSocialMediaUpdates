//} // you talked w Matt last class, you moved the posts to a seprate view controller, and you now need to possibly create another delegate that allows you to append data from the creation of a new post to both myProfileTableViewController, and HomeViewController, so a new post that you create appends to both view controllers. // This is been since completed.
// After that, you just need to finish the SettingsViewController, and then finish implimenting the API.
